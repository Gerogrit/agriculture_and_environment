## Introduction

This is the repo of [Gero Schomakers]() and [Dirk Albrechts]() capstone project of the data analytics bootcamp of [neue fische](). We had about a month from finding a topic to presenting.  
So, we started with a relatively broad topic of the effects of agriculture on the environment and then we narrowed it down. Goals we had were to find things out at a macro, meso and micro level and go on from this process.  
For the final presentation on our graduation day we reduced the message to that informed everyday decisions in our food can make a difference in reducing CO2 emissions.  
For the EDA portion of our research, we used Python in Jupyter Lab, PostgreSQL in DBeaver, Tableau and G Suite.  

## Technology

## Launch
First part of releasing the results of our research was a public presentation on our graduation day on the 15th of July in 2021.  
The second part is still in progress. We want to build a tool that helps people see how much CO2 emissions are on their plate, so that they can start thinking about an alternative.
